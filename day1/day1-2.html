                         Self-presentation: The process of self-presentation is important and difficult, so prefer to provide basic information about the person, and answer the questions of strangers who do not know the personality of the human, including the biography summary of the name, interests, talents, skills, achievements, study, and experience , And the challenges faced by man in his life
                      Include content: Select and customize specific topics, and take advantage of the previous step to strengthen the CV and increase its strength, and it is recommended to choose one thing and use it to describe your self in many situations and details rather than giving the other part  useless, divergent and scattered topics.
                         Use an accurate and good method: You should choose a suitable writing method when writing a CV. For example, I do not like writing” I like to swim”, but I prefer to add something special in writing so that the reader is related to the biography. It is preferable to write “I grew up playing swimming in various clubs and resorts. When I started practicing with my friends and I won competitions, I loved it more and more.”
                           Modesty: Whatever the talents and achievements of man should be mentioned in a modest manner, and it is advisable to stay away from bragging and pretending.

                       Choosing a special story: Personal articles require a person to talk about himself, to use the real situations he has experienced in his life, and to express a good or appropriate idea or topic. For example, it is possible to write about a problem that a person could overcome in his life or a success story of his successes , or a positive failure experience.
                      Focus on one topic: Focus on one idea or event according to the prescribed conditions. A person may need to link events but not to digres
                       It is advisable to write a personal essay in a concise and intensive way because it is impossible to write a five-page essay to talk about one topic. For example, if a person wants to talk about a story of emotional separation, he can shorten and not write about the first moment in which the acquaintance took place.
