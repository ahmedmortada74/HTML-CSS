            Self-presentation: The process of self-presentation is important and difficult, so prefer to provide basic information about the person, and answer the questions of strangers who do not know the personality of the human, including the biography summary of the name, interests, talents, skills, achievements, study, and experience , And the challenges faced by man in his life
            Include content: Select and customize specific topics, and take advantage of the previous step to strengthen the CV and increase its strength, and it is recommended to choose one thing and use it to describe your self in many situations and details rather than giving the other part  useless. For example, I do not like writing” I like to swim”, but I prefer to add something special in writing so that the reader is related to the biography. It is preferable to write “I grew up playing swimming in various clubs and resorts. When I started practicing with my friends and I won competitions.
